# Registration-Form

_What is the first thing to build when you start learning JavaScript? A calculator - evidently!<br>
Mine can only add, subtract, multiply and divide, that's why it is called "prehistoric"ü¶ñ or "antediluvian" ‚õàÔ∏è._
<br><br>
Registration-Form is a Java-Script training project created on week 15 and updated on week 18 of learning with [ITGirlSchool].

The task was to make a page that:
- on button press, asks user's name and alert with personal welcome-message
- has a simple 4-button calculator that requests 2 numbers and, on action choice, calculates the result

## Result
